# DICOM to MCNP parser

DICOM-MCNP-Parser is a DICOM to MCNP parser written in python. This parser can read a DICOM file section and convert to an MCNP input file. This is strictly a "geometry-converter" with the purpose of converting the informaton contained within a DICOM image into an MCNP input using macrobodies. After the conversion, the user still has to set up physics, particle importances, source as well as tallies tailored to her/his needs. 

This code was developed by Cheng Yi in his graduation thesis under the supervision of Ilker Meric and Icaro Valgueiro Malta Moreira.

# Installation

This script requires you to install pydicom(https://pydicom.github.io).
Download the dicom_mcnp_parser.py file and add to your project.

# Usage

Import the package "dicom_mcnp_parser".

```python
import dicom_mcnp_parser
```

Call "parse_dicom()" function, passing the path to the dicom file and the path to the exported imp(mcnp) file.

```python

from dicom_mcnp_parser import parse_dicom

parse_dicom("80_dicom_125mm.dcm", "80_dicom_125mm.imp")

```
